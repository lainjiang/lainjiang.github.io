Earlier this month, I ran across a cute puzzle book entitled 'Maze' by Christopher Manson. It is basically a picture story book of 45 pages long, each representing a 'room' in the maze. 
A typical page looks like this:

You are currently in room 8, and the room has connection to 31, 6, 29 and 12. You can only go forward (say you can go to room 6, but you can't come back to 8 from 6), and there are loops and deadends (say 1 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 3 is a  loop, and there are rooms that throw you in infinite darkness) The goal is to find the shortest path starting from room 1 to room 45 and back to room 1 again. 

Instead of having a huge spreadsheet noting every single possible paths and count the shortest one, I decide to use Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to solve the puzzle. The structure of the rooms is a typical directed graph (because of the one-directionality):

Above image is not an faithful representation of what our graph based on the book looks like, but you get the idea: each room can be seen as a node, and the connection to and from other rooms are edges. In addition, the connections are not weighted. Therefore, the problem becomes just to traverse a directed graph and find the shortest path between node 1 to node 45.

Now we have established the analogy and abstracted the problem, we can apply Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path. Starting from node 1, we conduct a breadth-first search and visit all the nodes that are connected to node 1 (20, 26, 41, 21) and note that these are the nodes that are accessible in 1 step; then we visit all the nodes that reachable in 2 steps, 3 steps, etc until we reach our goal. In the process if there's any repeat (for example, node 1 goes to node 20 goes to 32 that goes back to 26), then we discard that path since you can get to node 26 directly from node 1 within just 1 step.

So here it is - my solution to Christopher Manson's 'Maze'. I'm not sure if the author/artist intended for readers to do it this way, but it surely is a fun exercise!
