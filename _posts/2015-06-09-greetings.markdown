Hello everyone – this is my first blog since writing about French literature and film in college, and with a drastically different topic too – this is to record my effort and struggle through learning how to program as a beginner with little traditional technical background other than self-interest and the several [Processing][Processing] and [Arduino][Arduino] classes in grad school.

First I’d like to introduce a little bit about myself. My name is Lai Jiang, and you can call me Lain. I was born and raised in [Nanjing][Nanjing], China before moving to Charlottesville, Virginia for [college and gradschool][UVA]. A true liberal at heart, I studied film, media and French in college (partially to get through the language barrier at hand by taking tons of classes that require intense readings). Later, I got my Master’s degree in Architecture, my continuing interest in film and media prominent in many studio projects.

In grad school, I developed an interest in programming through architecture. Architecture as a subject is surprising broad despite of how specific of an impression it leaves on people – sure, conventionally it is a subject concerning buildings and how to build. The first half is straight forward, but the second half has extended itself beyond these physical structures: I’ve seen architecture breed versatile artists and engineers that invest in fields such as robotics, interactive media and UX design.

As of now, I finished my year-long internship at an award-winning and reputable firm [Griffin Enright Architects][GEA] in LA and have since moved to Huntsville, Alabama to be with my long-term boyfriend. I have used this time to study up on Java and Javascript, and I will use this blog to post some thoughts and problems I do.

Another purpose of this blog will be to record some preparation for Hack Reactor, which I intend to enroll for either the August or the October session. I understand the intensity of their admission process, but I am confident and it will not be a problem for me.
