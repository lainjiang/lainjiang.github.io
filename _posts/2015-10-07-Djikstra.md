Earlier this month, I ran across a cute puzzle book entitled 'Maze' by Christopher Manson. It is basically a picture story book of 45 pages long, each representing a 'room' in the maze. 
A typical page looks like this:

You are currently in room 8, and the room has connection to 31, 6, 29 and 12. You can only go forward, and there are loops and deadends (say 1 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 3 is a  loop, and there are rooms that throw you in infinite darkness) The goal is to find the shortest path starting from room 1 to room 45 and back to room 1 again. 

Instead of having a huge spreadsheet noting every single possible paths and count the shortest one, I decide to use Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to solve the puzzle. The structure of the rooms is a typical directed graph (because of the one-directionality):

each room can be seen as a node, and the connection to and from other rooms are edges. In addition, the connections are not weighted.
